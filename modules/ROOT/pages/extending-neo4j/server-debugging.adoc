:description: How to configure Neo4j for remote debugging sessions.


[[server-debugging]]
= Setup for remote debugging

To configure Neo4j for remote debugging sessions, the Java debugging parameters need to be passed to the Java process through the configuration.
They live in the _conf/neo4j.conf_ file.

To specify the parameters, you must add a line for the additional Java arguments:

[source, properties]
----
server.jvm.additional=-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=*:5005
----

This configuration starts Neo4j, ready for remote debugging attachment, at `localhost`` and port `5005`.
Use these parameters to attach to the process from Eclipse, IntelliJ, or your remote debugger of choice after starting the server.
