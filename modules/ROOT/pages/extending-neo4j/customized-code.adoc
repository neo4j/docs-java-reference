:description: Preferred means for extending Neo4j.

_User-defined procedures_ and _user-defined functions_ are mechanisms that enable you to extend Neo4j by writing customized code, which can be invoked directly from Cypher.
This is the preferred means for extending Neo4j.

Examples of use cases for procedures and functions are:

* To provide access to functionality that is not available in Cypher.
* To provide access to third party systems.
* To perform graph-global operations, such as counting connected components or finding dense nodes.
* To express a procedural operation that is difficult to express declaratively with Cypher.

Procedures and functions are written in Java and compiled into _jar_ files.
They are deployed to the database by dropping that _jar_ file into the _plugins_ directory on each standalone or clustered server.
For the location of the _plugins_ directory, refer to link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/operations-manual/{page-version}/configuration/file-locations[Operations Manual -> File locations].
The database must be re-started on each server to pick up new procedures and functions.

Procedures and functions can take arguments and return results.
In addition, procedures can perform write operations on the database.

| Type
| Description
| Syntax
| Read/Write
| Cardinality

| `Procedure`
| For each row the procedure takes parameters and returns multiple results.
| `+CALL abc(...)+`
| Update allowed.
| Changes cardinality similarly to a `MATCH` clause (0, 1, or many).

| `Scalar function`
| For each row the function takes parameters and returns a single result.
| `+abc(...)+`
| Read-only.
| Maintains cardinality, one for one.

| `Aggregating function`
| Consumes many rows and produces an aggregated result.
| `+WITH abc(...)+`
| Read-only.
| Reduces cardinality, many down to one.

Neo4j also comes bundled with a number of _built-in_ procedures and functions.

The available built-in procedures varies depending edition and mode, as described in link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/operations-manual/{page-version}/reference/procedures[Operations Manual -> Procedures].
Running `SHOW PROCEDURES` will display the full list of procedures available in a particular database instance, including user-defined procedures.

The built-in functions are described in link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/cypher-manual/{page-version}/functions[Cypher Manual -> Functions].
Running `SHOW FUNCTIONS` will display the full list of all the functions available in a particular database instance, including user-defined functions.
