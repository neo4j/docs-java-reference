= Values and types

The _input_ and _output_ to and from a procedure or a function must be one of the supported types, as described in link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/cypher-manual/{page-version}/values-and-types/[Cypher Manual -> Values and types].

Composite types are supported via:

* `List<T>`, where `T` is one of the supported types, and
* `Map<String, Object>`, where the values in the map must have one of the supported types.

The use of `Object` is supported for the case where the type is not known beforehand.
Note, however, that the actual value must still have one of the aforementioned types.

[NOTE]
====
There are two cases where more than one Java type is mapped to a single Cypher type.
When this happens, type information is lost.
If the following objects are returned from procedures, the original types cannot be recreated:

* A Cypher `Duration` is created when either `java.time.Duration` or `java.time.Period` is provided.
  If `Duration` is returned, only the common interface `java.time.temporal.TemporalAmount` remains.
* A Cypher `DateTime` is created when `java.time.OffsetDateTime` is provided.
  If `DateTime` is returned, it is converted into `java.time.ZonedDateTime`.
