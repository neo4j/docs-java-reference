= The Bidirectional Traversal Framework

A bidirectional traversal consists of two traversals starting from different nodes, returning the paths where both traversals collide.

The Bidirectional Traversal Framework allows the description of such a traversal with the link:{org-neo4j-graphdb-bidirectional-traversal-description}[BidirectionalTraversalDescription^].

Here's a visual representation of a bidirectional traversal from start node `1` and end node `5`,
where all bold relationships are in the result paths given the following restrictions:

* The start side traverser only traverses relationships of type `A`
* The end side traverser only traverses relationships of type `B`

Note that paths where only one of the traversers reaches the opposite start/end node are also included, such as `(1)-[:A]->(5)` and `(1)-[:B]->(5)`.
In the accepted path `(1)-[:A]->(2)-[:A]->(3)-[:B]->(4)-[:B]->(5)`, the traversers collide in the middle at node `3`.

[NOTE]
====
The Uniqueness is shared between both traversals, which means that there will be no results if the Uniqueness is set to `Uniqueness.NODE_GLOBAL`,
as both traversals need to reach the same node to cause a collision.
For this reason, always set the Uniqueness manually when using the `BidirectionalTraversalDescription`, since the default is `Uniqueness.NODE_GLOBAL`.

== Defining the Bidirectional Traverser
When creating a BidirectionalTraversalDescription it is possible to choose the TraversalDescription that each side takes.
This can be done by setting it individually for each side (startSide/endSide), or setting one for both (mirroredSides).

=== Start and End Side Traversal
Here is an example of using the `BidirectionalTraversalDescription` with a separate traverser for the `startSide()` and `endSide()`,
one side is traversing forward from the start node, expanding all outgoing relationships of Type `A`, the other side is traversing backwards
from the end node, expanding all incoming relationships of Type `B`.

The final paths will go from the start node to the end node where all relationships have an outgoing direction,
the possible paths would be:

* All relationships are of Type `A`
* All relationships are of Type `B`
* The relationships from the start node are Type `A` and after the collision are all of type `B`

                .uniqueness(Uniqueness.RELATIONSHIP_GLOBAL));
td.traverse(startNode, endNode);

=== Mirrored Traversal
The `mirroredSides(TraversalDescription)` method sets both the start side and end side of this bidirectional traversal, however the
end side will be the reverse of the start. For the `Direction` of `Relationships` this means that `OUTGOING` becomes `INCOMING` and vice versa.
The `PathExpander` interface also comes with a `reverse()` function which should be overridden if used in a `mirroredSides` implementation.

BidirectionalTraversalDescription td = transaction
        .bidirectionalTraversalDescription()
        .mirroredSides(transaction
                               .traversalDescription()
                               .uniqueness(Uniqueness.RELATIONSHIP_GLOBAL));
td.traverse(startNode, endNode);

== Side Selector
In a bidirectional traversal, the traverser selects which side (start or end) to move on each step.
It is possible to change how this works by implementing the `SideSelectorPolicy` interface, as it has a function for
determining which side to traverse the next step from.

* `Direction.OUTGOING` -- The traverser coming from the start node.
* `Direction.INCOMING` -- The traverser coming from the end node.

The built-in policies include:

* `SideSelectorPolicies.LEVEL` -- Stops traversal if the combined depth is larger than the given maximum depth.
* `SideSelectorPolicies.LEVEL_STOP_DESCENT_ON_RESULT` -- Stops as soon as a result is found.
* `SideSelectorPolicies.ALTERNATING` -- Alternates which branch continues the traversal.

The `SideSelectorPolicy` optionally takes a `maxDepth` which represents the combined depth that both sides must adhere to.

=== Example
Here's an example of how to use a built-in `SideSelectorPolicy` with a max combined depth of 5.

BidirectionalTraversalDescription td = transaction
        .bidirectionalTraversalDescription()
        .mirroredSides(transaction
                               .traversalDescription()
                               .uniqueness(Uniqueness.RELATIONSHIP_GLOBAL))
                               .sideSelector(SideSelectorPolicies.LEVEL, 5);
td.traverse(startNode, endNode);
----

== Collision Policies
The `BranchCollisionDetector` returns the paths which can be combined from the two given traversers.
A `BranchCollisionPolicy` then evaluates which of these paths should be included.

These are the build-in `BranchCollisionPolicies`:

* `STANDARD` -- Returns all paths with a collision.
* `SHORTEST_PATH` -- Returns all paths with the smallest traversal depth.

Here's an example of how to use a built-in `BranchCollisionPolicy`:

BidirectionalTraversalDescription td = transaction
        .bidirectionalTraversalDescription()
        .mirroredSides(transaction
                               .traversalDescription()
                               .uniqueness(Uniqueness.RELATIONSHIP_GLOBAL))
        .collisionPolicy(BranchCollisionPolicies.SHORTEST_PATH);
td.traverse(startNode, endNode);
----

== Collision Evaluator
There is a convenience method `collisionEvaluator()` for adding a `PathEvaluator` which will validate paths in a valid collision.
Using the method multiple times will combine the evaluators.

BidirectionalTraversalDescription td = transaction
    .bidirectionalTraversalDescription()
    .mirroredSides(transaction
       .traversalDescription()
       .uniqueness(Uniqueness.RELATIONSHIP_GLOBAL))
    .collisionEvaluator(Evaluators.atDepth(3));
td.traverse(startNode, endNode);
