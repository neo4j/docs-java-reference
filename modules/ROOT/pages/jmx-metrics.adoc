:description: Monitoring Neo4j DBMS metrics with JMX.


[[jmx-metrics]]
= JMX metrics

This topic describes how to access JMX for Neo4j DBMS to monitor metrics.

Neo4j provides different levels of monitoring facilities to supply a continuous overview of the system's health.
For a description of the monitoring options, see link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/operations-manual/{page-version}/monitoring[Neo4j Operations Manual -> Monitoring].
Many of the metrics are exposed through link:https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javamanagement.html[JMX^].

[NOTE]
====
The available JMX MBeans and their names have been updated in Neo4j 4.0.
Beans that duplicate metrics or monitoring options, described in link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/operations-manual/{page-version}/monitoring/metrics/reference/#jvm-metrics[Neo4j Operations Manual -> Monitoring], have been removed.
====

[[jmx-remote]]
== Adjusting remote JMX access to Neo4j

By default, the Neo4j Enterprise edition does not allow remote JMX connections.
To enable this feature, you need to enable JMX Remote Management and also configure JMX for secure remote access, in the link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/operations-manual/{page-version}/configuration/neo4j-conf[_conf/neo4j.conf_ file].


[[enable-jmx-remote]]
=== Enable JMX Remote Management

Add the following lines to the _conf/neo4j.conf_ file to enable JMX Remote Management.
If you run into issues with automatic hostname discovery, you can uncomment the following configuration line:

`+server.jvm.additional=-Djava.rmi.server.hostname=$THE_NEO4J_SERVER_HOSTNAME+`

[source, properties]
----
server.jvm.additional=-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=3637
server.jvm.additional=-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=true
server.jvm.additional=-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false

# Some systems cannot discover the hostname automatically, and need this line configured:
# server.jvm.additional=-Djava.rmi.server.hostname=$THE_NEO4J_SERVER_HOSTNAME
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Although SSL for JMX Remote Management is disabled throughout this document, to configure it based on your requirements, you can follow the instructions in the link:https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/management/monitoring-and-management-using-jmx-technology.html[Java SE 11 Monitoring and Management Guide^].
====


[[configure-password-authentication]]
=== Configure password authentication

Password authentication is enabled by default in JMX Remote Management.
You can find information about setting up authentication with LDAP and file-based approach in the following sections.

Refer to the link:https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/management/monitoring-and-management-using-jmx-technology.html[Java SE 11 Monitoring and Management Guide^] for more options, including configuration steps for SSL client authentication.


[[ldap]]
==== LDAP authentication

You can configure your JAAS login configuration based on your infrastructure and save it in the _conf/jmx.ldap_ configuration file.

[source, properties]
----
Neo4jJMXConfig {
    com.sun.security.auth.module.LdapLoginModule REQUIRED
    userProvider="ldap://127.0.0.1:10389/ou=users,dc=example,dc=net"
    authIdentity="uid={USERNAME},ou=users,dc=example,dc=net"
    userFilter="(&(samaccountname={USERNAME})(objectClass=inetOrgPerson))"
    useSSL=false
    debug=false
    authzIdentity=monitorRole;
};
----

`userProvider`::
Defines which LDAP server to connect and the node to perform the search against user entries.

`authIdentity`::
Defines the distinguished name of the user to authenticate to the LDAP server.
Note that the token `+{USERNAME}+` is replaced with the provided user name during authentication.

`userFilter`::
Defines the search filter to be used while locating the user.
Note that the token `+{USERNAME}+` is replaced with the provided user name during the search.

`useSSL`::
Defines whether to enable SSL for the underlying LDAP connection.

`debug`::
Defines whether to output debug info about the authentication session.

`authzIdentity`::
Specifies which access role an authenticated user will be granted.

[NOTE]
====
The provided configuration is an example and needs to be updated based on your infrastructure.
====

After finishing your JAAS configuration, configure JMX to use it by adding the following configuration items into _conf/neo4j.conf_ file:

[source, properties]
----
server.jvm.additional=-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.login.config=Neo4jJMXConfig
server.jvm.additional=-Djava.security.auth.login.config=/absolute/path/to/conf/jmx.ldap
----

With this setup, you can connect to JMX monitoring of the Neo4j server using `<IP-OF-SERVER>:3637`, with a valid username and password defined in your LDAP directory.


[[file]]
==== File-based authentication

[IMPORTANT]
====
The file-based password authentication stores the password in clear text and is intended only for development use.
====

You can set your password for JMX remote access and save it in the _conf/jmx.password_ configuration file.
Note that on Unix-based systems, the _jmx.password_ file needs to be owned by the user that runs the server, and has permissions set to `0600`.

[source, properties]
----
monitorRole password_to_be_changed
----

Next, configure the access level and save it in _conf/jmx.access_ configuration file.

[source, properties]
----
monitorRole readonly
----

Finally, configure JMX to use the completed password and access files by adding the following configuration items into _conf/neo4j.conf_ file:

[source, properties]
----
server.jvm.additional=-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.password.file=/absolute/path/to/conf/jmx.password
server.jvm.additional=-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.access.file=/absolute/path/to/conf/jmx.access
----

With this setup, you can connect to JMX monitoring of the Neo4j server using `<IP-OF-SERVER>:3637`, with the username `monitor`, and the password `password_to_be_changed`.


[[jmx-connect-jconsole]]
== Connecting to a Neo4j instance using JMX and JConsole

First, start your Neo4j instance, for example using:

[source, shell]
----
$NEO4j_HOME/bin/neo4j start
----

Now, start JConsole with:

[source, shell]
----
$JAVA_HOME/bin/jconsole
----

Connect to the process running your Neo4j database instance:

[NOTE]
====
When connecting to a remote process or, in some cases, a local process running as a service, you must choose the `Remote Process` connection option.

The `<port>` value is configured by the `com.sun.management.jmxremote.port` property.
====

Besides the MBeans, exposed by the JVM, you also see be default `neo4j.metrics` section in the MBeans tab.
Under that, you have access to all the monitoring information exposed by Neo4j.

For opening JMX to remote monitoring access, please see <<jmx-remote>> and link:https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/management/monitoring-and-management-using-jmx-technology.html#GUID-805517EC-2D33-4D61-81D8-4D0FA770D1B8[the JMX documention^].
