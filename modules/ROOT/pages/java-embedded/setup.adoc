= Including Neo4j in your project

This topic describes how to embed Neo4j in your Java application.

After selecting the appropriate <<editions,edition>> for your platform, you can embed Neo4j in your Java application by including the Neo4j library jars in your build.
The following sections show how to do this by either altering the build path directly or by using dependency management.


== Adding Neo4j to the build path

Get the Neo4j libraries from one of these sources:

* Extract a link:https://neo4j.com/download/other-releases/#releases[Neo4j zip/tarball^], and use the _jar_ files found in the _lib/_ directory.
* Use the _jar_ files available from link:http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|g%3A%22org.neo4j%22[Maven Central Repository^].

Add the jar files to your project:

JDK tools::
 Append to `-classpath`
Eclipse::
 * Right-click on the project and then go _Build Path -> Configure Build Path_.
   In the dialog, choose _Add External JARs_, browse to the Neo4j _lib/_ directory and select all of the jar files.
 * Another option is to use link:http://help.eclipse.org/indigo/index.jsp?topic=/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/reference/preferences/java/buildpath/ref-preferences-user-libraries.htm[User Libraries^].
IntelliJ IDEA::
 See link:http://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.1/configuring-project-and-global-libraries.html[Libraries, Global Libraries, and the Configure Library dialog^].
NetBeans::
 * Right-click on the _Libraries_ node of the project, choose _Add JAR/Folder_, browse to the Neo4j _lib/_ directory and select all of the jar files.
 * You can also handle libraries from the project node, see link:http://netbeans.org/kb/docs/java/project-setup.html#projects-classpath[Managing a Project's Classpath^].


[[editions]]
== Editions

The following table outlines the available editions and their names for use with dependency management tools.

[TIP]
====
Follow the links in the table for details on dependency configuration with Apache Maven, Apache Buildr, Apache Ivy, Groovy Grape, Grails, Scala SBT!
====

.Neo4j editions
[cols="<20,<30,<50", options="header"]
|===

| Neo4j Edition
| Dependency
| Description

| Community
| link:http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cgav%7C1%7Cg%3A%22org.neo4j%22%20AND%20a%3A%22neo4j%22[org.neo4j:neo4j^]
| A high performance, fully ACID transactional graph database.

| Enterprise
| link:http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cgav%7C1%7Cg%3A%22org.neo4j%22%20AND%20a%3A%22neo4j-enterprise%22[org.neo4j:neo4j-enterprise^]
| Adding advanced monitoring, online backup, and clustering.

|===

Note that the listed dependencies do not contain the implementation, but pulls it in transitively.

For information regarding licensing, see the link:https://neo4j.com/licensing[Licensing Guide^].

Javadocs can be downloaded packaged in jar files from Maven Central or read at link:{neo4j-javadocs-base-uri}/[Neo4j Javadocs^].


== Adding Neo4j as a dependency

You can either go with the top-level artifact from the table above or include the individual components directly.
The examples included here use the top-level artifact approach.


[NOTE]
.[enterprise-edition]#Additional information for Enterprise Edition users.#
====
The examples below are only valid Neo4j Community Edition.

To add Neo4j Enterprise Edition as a dependency, please get in contact with Neo4j Professional Services.

See link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/operations-manual/{neo4j-version}/introduction[Operations Manual -> Introduction] for details about the Community and Enterprise Editions.
====


=== Maven

Add the dependency to your project along the lines of the snippet below.
This is usually done in the _pom.xml_ file found in the root directory of the project.

["source", "xml", "unnumbered", "2", subs="attributes, specialcharacters"]
----
<project>
...
 <dependencies>
  <dependency>
   <groupId>org.neo4j</groupId>
   <artifactId>neo4j</artifactId>
   <version>{neo4j-version-exact}</version>
  </dependency>
  ...
 </dependencies>
...
</project>
----

Where the `artifactId` is found in the editions table.


=== Eclipse and Maven

For development in link:http://www.eclipse.org[Eclipse^], it is recommended to install the link:http://www.eclipse.org/m2e/[m2e plugin^] and let Maven manage the project build classpath instead, see above.
This also adds the possibility to build your project both via the command line with Maven and have a working Eclipse setup for development.


=== Ivy

Make sure to resolve dependencies from Maven Central.
You can use this configuration in your _ivysettings.xml_ file:

[source,xml]
----
<ivysettings>
  <settings defaultResolver="main"/>
  <resolvers>
    <chain name="main">
      <filesystem name="local">
        <artifact pattern="${ivy.settings.dir}/repository/[artifact]-[revision].[ext]" />
      </filesystem>
      <ibiblio name="maven_central" root="http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/" m2compatible="true"/>
    </chain>
  </resolvers>
</ivysettings>
----

With that in place, add Neo4j by adding this to your 'ivy.xml' file:

["source", "xml", "unnumbered", "2", subs="attributes, specialcharacters"]
----
..
<dependencies>
  ..
  <dependency org="org.neo4j" name="neo4j" rev="{neo4j-version-exact}"/>
  ..
</dependencies>
..
----

The `name` can be found in the editions table above.


=== Gradle

The example below shows an example Gradle build script for including the Neo4j libraries:

["source","groovy","unnumbered","2",subs="attributes"]
----
def neo4jVersion = "{neo4j-version-exact}"
apply plugin: 'java'
repositories {
   mavenCentral()
}
dependencies {
   compile "org.neo4j:neo4j:$\{neo4jVersion}"
}
----

The coordinates (`org.neo4j:neo4j` in the example) are found in the editions table above.


[[tutorials-java-embedded-setup-startstop]]
== Starting and stopping

To create a new database or open an existing one you instantiate a link:{org-neo4j-graphdb-GraphDatabaseService}[`org.neo4j.graphdb.GraphDatabaseService`^].

//https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-documentation/blob/dev/embedded-examples/src/main/java/org/neo4j/examples/EmbeddedNeo4j.java
//EmbeddedNeo4j.java[tag=startDb]

[source, java]
----
graphDb = new GraphDatabaseFactory().newEmbeddedDatabase( databaseDirectory );
registerShutdownHook( graphDb );
----


If you are using the Enterprise Edition of Neo4j in embedded standalone mode, you have to create your database with the link:{org-neo4j-graphdb-factory-EnterpriseGraphDatabaseFactory}[`org.neo4j.graphdb.factory.EnterpriseGraphDatabaseFactory`^] to enable the Enterprise Edition features.

If you wish to use the High Availability clustering features, instead use the link:{org-neo4j-graphdb-factory-HighlyAvailableGraphDatabaseFactory}[`org.neo4j.graphdb.factory.HighlyAvailableGraphDatabaseFactory`^].
This includes Enterprise Edition.

[NOTE]
====
link:{org-neo4j-graphdb-factory-HighlyAvailableGraphDatabaseFactory}[`org.neo4j.graphdb.factory.HighlyAvailableGraphDatabaseFactory`^] is deprecated and will be replaced in a future release. label:deprecated[]
====

There is no factory for the Causal Clustering features, as it is currently not possible to run a Causal Cluster in embedded mode.

[NOTE]
====
A `GraphDatabaseService` instance can be shared among multiple threads.
Note however, that you cannot create multiple services pointing to the same database.
====

To stop the database, call the `shutdown()` method:

//https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-documentation/blob/3.5/embedded-examples/src/main/java/org/neo4j/examples/EmbeddedNeo4j.java
//EmbeddedNeo4j.java[tag=shutdownServer]

[source, java]
----
graphDb.shutdown();
----

To make sure Neo4j is shut down properly, add a shutdown hook:

//https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-documentation/blob/3.5/embedded-examples/src/main/java/org/neo4j/examples/EmbeddedNeo4j.java
//EmbeddedNeo4j.java[tag=shutdownHook]

[source, java]
----
private static void registerShutdownHook( final GraphDatabaseService graphDb )
{
    // Registers a shutdown hook for the Neo4j instance so that it
    // shuts down nicely when the VM exits (even if you "Ctrl-C" the
    // running application).
    Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook( new Thread()
    {
        @Override
        public void run()
        {
            graphDb.shutdown();
        }
    } );
}
----


[[tutorials-java-embedded-setup-config]]
=== Starting an embedded database with configuration settings

To start Neo4j with configuration settings, a Neo4j properties file can be loaded like this:

//https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-documentation/blob/3.5/embedded-examples/src/test/java/org/neo4j/examples/StartWithConfigurationDocTest.java
//StartWithConfigurationDocTest.java[tag=startDbWithConfig]

[source, java]
----
GraphDatabaseService graphDb = new GraphDatabaseFactory()
    .newEmbeddedDatabaseBuilder( testDirectory.databaseDir() )
    .loadPropertiesFromFile( pathToConfig + "neo4j.conf" )
    .newGraphDatabase();
----

Configuration settings can also be applied programmatically, like so:

//https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-documentation/blob/3.5/embedded-examples/src/test/java/org/neo4j/examples/StartWithConfigurationDocTest.java
//StartWithConfigurationDocTest.java[tag=startDbWithMapConfig]

[source, java]
----
GraphDatabaseService graphDb = new GraphDatabaseFactory()
    .newEmbeddedDatabaseBuilder( testDirectory.databaseDir() )
    .setConfig( GraphDatabaseSettings.pagecache_memory, "512M" )
    .setConfig( GraphDatabaseSettings.string_block_size, "60" )
    .setConfig( GraphDatabaseSettings.array_block_size, "300" )
    .newGraphDatabase();
----


[[tutorials-java-embedded-setup-readonly]]
=== Starting an embedded read-only instance

If you want a _read-only view_ of the database, create an instance this way:

//https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-documentation/blob/3.5/embedded-examples/src/test/java/org/neo4j/examples/ReadOnlyDocTest.java
//ReadOnlyDocTest.java[tag=createReadOnlyInstance]

[source, java]
----
graphDb = new GraphDatabaseFactory().newEmbeddedDatabaseBuilder( dir )
        .setConfig( GraphDatabaseSettings.read_only, "true" )
        .newGraphDatabase();
----

Obviously, the database has to already exist in this case.

[NOTE]
====
Concurrent access to the same database files by multiple (read-only or write) instances is not supported.
