:description: Properties for nodes and relationships.


[[property-values-detailed]]
= Property values

This describes how both nodes and relationships can have properties.

Properties are named values where the name is a string.
Property values can be either a primitive or an array of one primitive type.
For example `String`, `int`, and `int[]` values are valid for properties.

[NOTE]
====
`NULL` is *not a valid* property value.
Setting a property to `NULL` is equivalent to deleting the property.

| float                             | 32-bit IEEE 754 floating-point number.
| double                            | 64-bit IEEE 754 floating-point number.
| char                              | 16-bit unsigned integers representing Unicode characters.
| String                            | Sequence of Unicode characters.
| org.neo4j.graphdb.spatial.Point   | A 2D or 3D point object in a given coordinate system.
| java.time.LocalDate               | An instant capturing of the date, but not the time and timezone.
| java.time.OffsetTime              | An instant capturing of the time of day and the timezone offset, but not the date.
| java.time.LocalTime               | An instant capturing of the time of day, but not the date and timezone.
| java.time.ZonedDateTime           | An instant capturing of the date, time, and timezone.
| java.time.LocalDateTime           | An instant capturing of the date and time, but not the timezone.
| java.time.temporal.TemporalAmount | A temporal amount. This captures the difference in time between two instants.

For further details on float/double values, see link:http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-4.html#jls-4.2.3[Java Language Specification].

Note that there are two cases where more than one Java type is mapped to a single Cypher type.
When this happens, type information is lost.
If these objects are returned from procedures, the original types cannot be recreated:

* A Cypher `Duration` is created when either `java.time.Duration` or `java.time.Period` is provided.
  If `Duration` is returned, only the common interface `java.time.temporal.TemporalAmount` remains.
* A Cypher `DateTime` is created when `java.time.OffsetDateTime` is provided.
  If `DateTime` is returned, it is converted into `java.time.ZonedDateTime`.

[NOTE]
====
Strings that contain special characters can have inconsistent or non-deterministic ordering in Neo4j.
For details, see link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/cypher-manual/current/syntax/values#property-types-sip-note[Cypher Manual -> Sorting of special characters].
